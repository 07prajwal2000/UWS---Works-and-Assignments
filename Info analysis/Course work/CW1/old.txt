Concerns

1. Customer data should be accurate and must not be outdated or inaccurate and not to store longer than required.
2. We need to make sure that all important business data can be recovered if a disaster occurs.
3. Personalized ads, offers, and data tracking can make customers feel like they are being monitored.
4. Protecting customer contact information is essential for maintaining trust and compliance with data protection regulations.
5. The "chilling effect" occurs when customers modify their behavior because they are aware of digital surveillance, causing disengagement and self-censorship.
6. Accessing data without permission and without a legitimate job-related need.
7. Securing customerâ€™s financial data.
8. Unauthorized system access can lead to data breaches, which can lead to loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information.
9. Customers should be informed about the intended uses of their data.
10. Unauthorized modification and misusing the data cannot be identified without proper monitoring.


Actions
1. Collection of data should be regularly updated, maintained such as phone, email, address etc. Also, not to store it when no longer necessary.
2. Creating backup of all the required data and stored in multiple locations with redundancy is important for ensuring data recovery.
3. Data tracking should occur only when necessary, such as for sending notifications or reminders. This method minimizes unnecessary collection of data improves user privacy.
4. Storing and retrieving contact information only when necessary, such as during customer interactions is crucial for protecting sensitive data.
5. Minimizing unnecessary data collection, increasing transparency about the data processing methods. This approach ensures compliance with data protection rules & regulations.
6. Implementing RBAC (Role-Based-Access-Control) to the system allows more fine-grained access to business data enhancing security and reducing risk of data leak.
7. Encrypting critical payment information, such as card details and PINs, is vital for data security. Algorithms like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) provide efficient symmetric encryption.
8. Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for staff members can significantly reduce the risk of data breaches.
9. Organizations should provide transparent privacy policies that clearly outline how customer data is collected, used, processed, and protected. This transparency shows trust and ensures compliance with data protection regulations.
10. Maintaining audit trails and logs provides clear view of who has accessed the data for what purpose. Regularly reviewing logs can help detect unwanted activities.
